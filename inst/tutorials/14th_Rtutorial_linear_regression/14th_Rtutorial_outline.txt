```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(mosaic)
library(openintro)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r look}
Mustangs
```

```{r line-plot}
#Note you do need a data argument because we're dealing with a data frame.
gf_point(____~____, data = Mustangs) %>%
  gf_lm(____~____, data = )

```


## Find the correlation coefficient and equation.



```{r lm}
hp_mpg_model <- lm(hp~mpg)
hp_mpg_model
```

The Equation is:

$y= x +  $



```{r summary}
msummary(hp_mpg_model)

cor(hp~mpg)
```

## Conclusion



## Assignment

5 points

Make a linear regression model for `Age` vs `Price` from the `Mustangs` data frame from the `mosaic` package.

Give the equation, correlation coefficient, a title, and good x and y axes labels.

Knit your document as an html and post it to the forum.
