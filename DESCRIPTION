Description: This package is a collection of 14 learnr tutorials that I made for an Intro to Statistics Course taught at Holyoke Community College.I use the `mosaic` , `openintro`, and `tidyverse` packages. Formula \~ syntax is used whenever possible.The textbook is OpenIntro's Introduction to Statistics. MyOpenMath is the LMS and has homework problems from the text.There is a template course on MyOpenMath that was put together by Adam Gilbert of Southern New Hampshire University.
